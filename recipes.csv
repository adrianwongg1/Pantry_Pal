Spanish Egg and Rice Skillet

Ingredients:
2 tsp olive oil
1 brown onion, finely diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 red or green bell pepper, sliced into strips
1 cup long grain rice
2 cups chicken broth
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1/4 tsp. paprika
1/4 tsp. ground cumin
2 eggs
1/4 cup grated cheese (optional)

Directions:
1. Heat olive oil over medium heat in a large skillet. Add onion, garlic, and bell pepper and sauté for 4-5 minutes, until fragrant and vegetables begin to soften. 
2. Add rice and stir to lightly toast for about 1 minute.
3. Add chicken broth and diced tomatoes, and season with paprika and cumin. Bring to a low boil, cover and reduce heat to low, cooking for 18-20 minutes until rice is tender.
4. Make two “wells” in the rice and crack an egg into each well. Increase heat to medium and cook, covered for about 5 minutes until egg whites are cooked but the yolks are still runny.
5. Sprinkle with cheese, if desired, and cook for 1 or 2 minutes more until cheese is melted then serve. Enjoy!$null\$null\\$null\\\$null\\\\$null\\\\\$
